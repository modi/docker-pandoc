民为国基，谷为民命。粮食事关国运民生，粮食安全是国家安全的重要基础。新中国成立后，中国始终把解决人民吃饭问题作为治国安邦的首要任务。70年来，在中国共产党领导下，经过艰苦奋斗和不懈努力，中国在农业基础十分薄弱、人民生活极端贫困的基础上，依靠自己的力量实现了粮食基本自给，不仅成功解决了近14亿人口的吃饭问题，而且居民生活质量和营养水平显著提升，粮食安全取得了举世瞩目的巨大成就。

党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央把粮食安全作为治国理政的头等大事，提出了“确保谷物基本自给、口粮绝对安全”的新粮食安全观，确立了以我为主、立足国内、确保产能、适度进口、科技支撑的国家粮食安全战略，走出了一条中国特色粮食安全之路。中国坚持立足国内保障粮食基本自给的方针，实行最严格的耕地保护制度，实施“藏粮于地、藏粮于技”战略，持续推进农业供给侧结构性改革和体制机制创新，粮食生产能力不断增强，粮食流通现代化水平明显提升，粮食供给结构不断优化，粮食产业经济稳步发展，更高层次、更高质量、更有效率、更可持续的粮食安全保障体系逐步建立，国家粮食安全保障更加有力，中国特色粮食安全之路越走越稳健、越走越宽广。

## 二级标题-2

The people are the foundation of a country; food is the primary need of the people. As food decides national prosperity and the people’s wellbeing, food security is a major prerequisite for national security. Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, China has always prioritized food security in state governance. Despite a weak agricultural foundation and extreme poverty, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has led an unremitting campaign of hard work over the past 70 years that has made China basically self-sufficient in food supply. China now has enough food to feed its nearly 1.4 billion population, and has remarkably improved the people’s nutrition and life quality. China’s food security is a success of worldwide significance.

Since the CPC’s 18th National Congress in 2012, the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping as its core has treated food security as a top state issue. The central leadership has introduced a food security policy of “ensuring basic self-sufficiency of grain and absolute security of staple food”. The Chinese government has established a national strategy on food security featuring self-sufficiency based on domestic grain production, guaranteed food production capacity, moderate imports, and technological support. Abiding by the principle of basic food self-sufficiency based on domestic grain production, China practices the strictest farmland protection system and a strategy of sustainable farmland use and innovative application of agricultural technology to increase farmland productivity. Through supply-side structural reform and institutional innovation in agriculture, China has raised grain productivity, modernized grain circulation, improved food-supply structure, and achieved steady development in the grain industry. Step by step, China has established a food security guarantee system at a very high level characterized by quality, efficiency and sustainability. China’s food security has a stronger guarantee, along a steadier and wider path with Chinese characteristics.
